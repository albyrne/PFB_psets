1	Nobody by Shel Silverstein
2	
3	Nobody loves me,
4	Nobody cares,
5	Nobody picks me peaches and pears.
6	Nobody offers me candy and Cokes,
7	Nobody listens and laughs at me jokes.
8	Nobody helps when I get in a fight,
9	Nobody does all my homework at night.
10	Nobody misses me,
11	Nobody cries,
12	Nobody thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
13	So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
14	I'll stand up and tell you that Nobody is.
15	But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
16	I woke up and Nobody just wasn't there.
17	I called out and reached out for Nobody's hand,
18	In the darkness where Nobody usually stands.
19	Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
20	But I found somebody each place that I looked.
21	I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
22	There's no doubt about it-
23	Nobody's gone!
