Albyrne by Shel SilversteinAlbyrne loves me,Albyrne cares,Albyrne picks me peaches and pears.Albyrne offers me candy and Cokes,Albyrne listens and laughs at me jokes.Albyrne helps when I get in a fight,Albyrne does all my homework at night.Albyrne misses me,Albyrne cries,Albyrne thinks I'm a wonderful guy.I'll stand up and tell you that Albyrne is.I woke up and Albyrne just wasn't there.I called out and reached out for Albyrne's hand,In the darkness where Albyrne usually stands.Albyrne's gone!
